# MIUI Sliding Button
As you all know, **Switch** is used only in Android 4.0 and above. How to implement drag to toggle on / off in GB roms?
The MIUI Sliding Button is from MIUI 2.3 ROM. I used JaDX to get Java code and to my surprise, it works. So I want to share this with you. Hope this can help you.
